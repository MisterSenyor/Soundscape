Freddie Sharp was created by Ludwig Vanderdyke, but when Freddie saw that his creator was using a **light-themed IDE**, his eyes were shattered.

# About
This game was made by Nerya and Ido (Nehr-yuh and Ee-dough for easy pronunciation) and is our submission to the 4th Timathon.
This game was made over the course of 3 weeks, being mainly comprised of JavaScript.
Using our special and original beat detection algorithm, we managed to recognize the beats in almost every song!
